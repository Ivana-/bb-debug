## Overview

Two macroses, `dbg` and `dbg-all`, allows to set up single/multiple named/unnamed perpetual/conditional breakpoints in your Clojure code.

Two another macroses, `inspect` and `watch`, allows to inspect any Clojure values, even lazy ones, statically and dynamically on debug session.

`dbg-all*` macro expands multiple breakpoint forms and pretty-prints it with highlighted breakpoints.

`last-context` function jumps you into nested REPL session with last debug context loaded and allows to inspect its local state. It especially useful after debug session breaking cause of exception.

See `example.clj` and try eval it forms in REPL.
